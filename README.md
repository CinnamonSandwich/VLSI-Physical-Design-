# VLSI Physical Design For ASIC

## Introduction
VLSI is short for Very Large Scale Intergration, it is the backbone of electronic chipset and circut design.This involves combining millions and billions of transistors into a single chip.
ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. These chips are designed to perform only one particular task or application and cannot be reprogrammed or modified after its production.
